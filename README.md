# ✨ Astrology Message Generator

This is a randomized message generator written in JavaScript.  
Each time you run the program, you get a fresh, fun, and mystical astrology-based message.

## 🌙 How It Works

The program randomly selects from 4 different arrays:
- Zodiac signs
- Moods
- Actions
- Events

Then it generates a unique message like:

> "You’re a Scorpio. Today, your vibe is moody. You should nap instead of making decisions before Mercury goes retrograde."

## 🛠️ Tech Used

- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download the repo  
2. Navigate into the project folder  
3. Run this command in the terminal:

```bash
node script.js
